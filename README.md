# Gitgle: a Github Repository Search Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Application Details

## Application Layout

The application consists of three pages: Home, Search, and Result. The routing is handled in App.js.
Each page directory has its own components and tests folder. Functions and components shared throughout the application can be found in the common directory.

## Application Features

1. Search Input

- An input to type in the text to search github.

2. Search results

- Show the results of the search.

3. Sort results

- By best match (default) - Stars

4. Filter results

- By language

5. Detailed Result Page

- A page that when a result is clicked shows a detailed screen of the repository.

6. Responsive Design

- Should render properly on device sizes. (mobile, tablet, laptop, large desktop)

## Tools Leveraged

1. Notistack for snackbar components used in error handling
2. PropTypes for run-time typechecking
3. Jest and React-Testing-Library for tests
4. Material UI for custom components
5. Nivo for chart components
6. React-router-dom for routing
7. Axios for API calls

## Next Steps

1. More extensive testing
2. Adding query parameters to our routing code
3. More extensive theming
4. Introduce Typescript
